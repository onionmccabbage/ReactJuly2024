Optional Consolidation Exercise
===============================
Continue with the jsonplaceholder.typicode api
This api provides /photos /users /todos /post
- Let the user choose which collection of data they want 
    (maybe a drop-down)
- Render different content depending on the category
- Find a way to show post for a particular user
    (selects a user then show that users details and their posts )
Use custom hooks for the api requests
