Build a new React project that will consume the API available at
  https://swapi.dev/api/planets/2

The user may enter a category and an id
Category may be people, planets, species, starships or vehicles
NB some do not work
Ammend the 'weather' routed app to use this API
Or else use any strategy
Use handlers for problems like vehicles/2

Optional
========
Use debugger; to run in debug mode - step through your code
Create a top-level Swapi class with 'name'
Then subclass for Species etc.

You might choose to implement Observables for the form field values (category and id)
