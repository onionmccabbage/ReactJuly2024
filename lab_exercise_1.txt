Exercise 1
==========
Work on your own or together
At the end there will be an opportunity to show code
Adapt these ideas to suit your own thinking

In a new React project, retrieve data from 
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/
Write a component to render one photo and it's title
Iterate over the returned data to show the retrieved photos
(there are 5000 photos in this data set)

Add a form with a field to control which album to show
(every photo has an albumId which is an integer 1-100)
Filter the photos to show just the chosen album photos 
(there are 50 photos per album)

Optional (if time)
==================
Provide a means for the user to pick a specific photo ID (1-5000)
You could do this by appending `id` to the end of the url
    apiUrl = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/${id}`
Or you could filter the photos you have already downloaded
In either case, let the user choose whether to: 
- show just one photo (match an id)
- or show many photos (an album of photos or all the photos)
