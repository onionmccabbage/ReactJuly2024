Continue with the routed app.

Build new components that will consume the weather API available at
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=hull&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
  (this includes my API key, good for 60 requests per minute. You can sign up for free for your own API key)
The user may enter a city (string at least two characters)
Fetch the weather report and show the description, temperature and wind-speed
(You may choose to display ther returned data members)
Include the city name and a date-time when the report was retrieved

Aim for good architecture with modular construction 
Choose where state should be managed
You could write a custom hook to manage the fetched weather

Details
-------
- Ask the user for a 'city' (hull in the example)
- Use this to make a request to the API (handle problems elegantly)
- From the response.json, show the weather description and temperature
	weather[0][description] and main.temp (also wind.speed)
- You may choose to show other data members
- Make use of the React Dev Tools where necessary

Optional
--------
- Refer to the react-router-dom documentation about passing arguments
  https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#the-contact-route-ui
  Pass the city value into a child route to show weather results
- Ensure the weather data is type-safe (e.g. write an interface or class for Weather)
- validate city either as non-empty string or as one from some permitted values
- persist the most-recent city choice, so that they are retrieved when the page first loads
  Use them to pre-populate the form fields (Maybe use localStorage)
- consider a strategy to cache the weather response for a particular request
- When weather reports are retrieved, show them nicely

If Time
-------
- use the API at https://ipapi.co to guess the users location then automatically retrieve the weather
- Make the weather retrieval happen automatically every 30 seconds

For any given rendition of the app, store each weather report in an array of Weather instances. 
Provide a means to retrieve this array and display it nicely (maybe routing, but state might be a problem)
