Mini-Challenge
==============
We need a component to render a persons name, age and status 
    e.g. a <Label /> component
This component does not need it's own state, but will receive static properties
Decide (in the parent component) how to declare the name, age and status
Decide how these three data members should be rendered in the 'return' of the Label component

Place a couple of instances of this component in the App
(each with different values)

NB for now use :any for types
